## Description

_This web application uses objects, prototypes, looping, and arrays to recieve a user's pizza order, then calculates the cost of the order based on the amount of toppings. There are different categories of prices. It allows the user to place multiple pizza orders if desired, and then allows for the option of delivery or pickup, giving an estimated ready/delivery time depending on the number of pizzas. If you order 5 pizzas, you'll be greeted by the Pizza God._
